# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

We plan to create a service that simplifies using AWS for cloud-based app streaming of Slicer (with or without extensions, or a Slicer custom app), effectively resulting in a single-click launch of the desired Slicer distribution in a new tab in the web browser.
In this project we are looking to gather requirements, expectations, limitations, or any kind of information we should take into account while planning and then developing the service.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Objective A. Talk to as many interested people as possible about where and how they would use it, and what expectations they have about such service

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Small breakout session about Slicer in web
2. Small breakout session about SlicerHub (Rafael Nebot)
3. Demo of ImagineHive (Davide)

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1. Explored several existing use cases in the breakout sessions
2. Learned a lot about possible approches and problems

# Illustrations
