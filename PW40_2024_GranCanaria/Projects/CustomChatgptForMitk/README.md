# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

Development of a custom ChatGPT tailored specifically for the users & developers of the Medical Imaging Interaction Toolkit (MITK). The objective is to create a conversational AI interface that assists MITK users or in navigating the software, troubleshooting issues esp. for developers, and obtaining relevant information. Leveraging the advances in the field of AI, the custom GPT (e.g. MITK GPT) can provide personalized assistance adapting to individual preferences and workflows.

One of the easiest ways to materialize this proposal to use the OpenAI's custom GPT feature and expand on it.

Even though the proposal is currently pitched for MITK, it could benefit other tools eg. Slicer3D, as well.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

Custom versions of ChatGPT for the users & developers of the Medical Imaging Interaction Toolkit (MITK)

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

* One of the easiest ways to materialize this proposal to use the OpenAI's custom GPT feature and expand on it.
<https://openai.com/blog/introducing-gpts>
* Build deployable solutions outside ChatGPT.
* Explore feasibility of chat LLM solutions out there for MITK users & dev.

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->
* We created a CustomGPT inside ChatGPT for MITK. Introducing: MITK Buddy!
  * URL: https://chat.openai.com/g/g-E36xLFyf5-mitk-buddy 
  * Only available for ChatGPT Plus users. 
* We explored building our own (semi-)local solutions for retrieval-augmented generation.
  * Developed prototype web app based on Streamlit & Langchain (Python) libraries.
  * Code publically available here:
* Explored other online LLM solutions out there which works nicely with MITK.
  * ChatGPT knowledge is only until Jan 2022.
  * Phind.com seems updated & catered more towarding helping developers.
